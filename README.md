# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction – Streamlit App

This project is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the presence of heart disease using patient health parameters. The application is built using **Streamlit** and an **ensemble of machine learning models**, where the final prediction is made using **majority voting** to improve reliability and accuracy.
